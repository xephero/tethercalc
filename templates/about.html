<h1>What is this?</h1>

<p>This is a tool to calculate the optimal target for a Dragoon's "Dragon Sight" ability in Final Fantasy XIV</p>

<h2>Does it account for...</h2>

<p>Generally, yes. Specifically it accounts for these commonly asked things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Excludes pet damage</li>
    <li>Excludes the 5% damage buff on the real Dragon Sight target</li>
    <li>Excludes ticks from DoTs snapshotted before the tether window</li>
    <li>Excludes ticks from DoTs snapshotted after the tether window</li>
    <li>Includes ticks from DoTs snapshotted inside the tether window, including ticks that happen afterward</li>
    <li>Includes the portion of Wildfire damage generated by damage inside the tether window (Stormblood logs only)</li>
    <li>Includes damage from ground effect DoTs (Shadow Flare, Doton, Salted Earth, Flamethrower, Slipstream)</li>
    <li>Includes damage from Radiant Shield (when applicable)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>This is the methodology used by the script for each tether window</p>
<ol>
    <li>Get all of the non-tick, non-pet direct damage inside the 20 second window for each player</li>
    <li>Walk through each debuff and tick event.
        <ul>
            <li>While inside the window, keep a list of every debuff application we see. Remove debuffs that fade</li>
            <li>For every tick, add it only if there's been an application of that debuff inside the window</li>
            <li>For Stormblood wildfire, take 25% of the non-pet damage done inside the tether window, if tether was only up for some part of it</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Take out the 5% bonus to the player that actually receieved the tether</li>
</ol>

<p>After doing all of that, the result is an accurate representation of the <strong>total amount of damage that would have been buffed by the Left Eye buff</strong>, if that player were its target.</p>

<h2>Who made this?</h2>

<p>I am Platinum Xephera on the Ultros server. I made this because, while the methodology is fairly straightforward, it is incredibly tedious to do by hand with FFLogs. Doing it across many pulls, for every tether usage, is just way too much work compared to the bonus given. Many dragoons didn't bother, I know I didn't, and I thought more would if there was a tool that did the tedious stuff for them. I hope the {{ report_count }} analyzed reports have been useful.</p>
<p>If you notice any issues, feel free to @ me in the dragoon channels in the balance, or open issues and pull requests on the <a href="https://github.com/xephero/tethercalc">GitHub repo</a> for this site.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>I've made some errors in the past with this calculation which have necessitated some corrections. Note that viewing a stored report calculated on an older method than the current one will automatically recalculate and update the results. If you're looking at a report here, it's using the most up to date version.</p>

<p>On March 11, 2018, I fixed an error that caused wildfire damage to not add correctly if it was only partially within the window. That was addressed in commit <a href="https://github.com/xephero/tethercalc/commit/0a5f34b0a6957e0abb4b62cdde9486a106cdf569">0a5f34b</a>.</p>

<p>On March 31, 2018, I added support for ground effect AoEs (Shadow Flare, Doton, and Salted Earth), which were unintentionally being ignored, as well as Radiant Shield damage, which was intentionally overlooked since it was a minor contribution. This was addressed in commit <a href="https://github.com/xephero/tethercalc/commit/406c790dfb9f92d841cdd167481bab7cfa4c916d">406c790</a>.</p>

<p>On June 10, 2018, I fixed an error caused by Dragon Sight being used pre-pull. This was addressed in commit <a href="https://github.com/xephero/tethercalc/commit/f689fcd0fb0b771ec21d5f6f749695a25db876f7">f689fcd</a>.</p>

<p>On October 7, 2018, I fixed an error caused when wildfire expired on a target without dealing damage. This was addressed in commit <a href="https://github.com/xephero/tethercalc/commit/fe731abfbd74c0591ef19f23757d773a899442b2">fe731ab</a>

<p>On July 21, 2019, I added Shadowbringers support. Stormblood logs will still use the old logic and should produce the same results as before. Flamethrower damage was also not included in the damage totals previously, as it functions like a ground effect aoe but was not included in the special handling for those; as a result, even in Stormblood logs, machinists may see a few extra thousand damage. In Shadowbringers, wildfire functions conveniently like a normal dot, where all snapshotting takes place when the debuff is placed, and this behavior is accounted for properly now. This is addressed in <a href="https://github.com/xephero/tethercalc/commit/c2ea0b1f9e1fa2e2b7502f7857d454fa7650748a">c2ea0b1</a>.

<p>On January 24, 2022, I added support for Summoner's Slipstream ability (now sourced from the player, rather than garuda-egi) and updated the about page. This is addressed in <a href="https://github.com/xephero/tethercalc/commit/2dde98321d093840a5cf4c29103d912c31d4c016">2dde983</a>.</p>

<p>On August 25, 2022, I moved this site to its own domain to prepare for heroku removing their free tier, which is where this was previously running.</p>
